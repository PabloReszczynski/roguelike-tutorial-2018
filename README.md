Explanations of each week's work can be found in the
[lessons](https://github.com/Lokathor/roguelike-tutorial-2018/tree/master/lessons)
directory. Also, the complete code as it was at the end of a week will be put up

## Story

You are **Kasidin**, a **Terulo**. You live a quiet life of eating **rocks** and
drinking **spicy lava soup**. One day, the **Evil King Adlori** invaded the land
of volcanos and shut off all of the lava. Now there is no more **spicy lava
soup**! You must travel deep into the heart of the earth and defeat **Adlori**
to restore the soup.
