Roguelike Tutorial Series: 2018 Edition

Explanations of each week's work can be found in the
[lessons](https://github.com/Lokathor/roguelike-tutorial-2018/tree/master/lessons)
directory. Also, the complete code as it was at the end of a week will be put up
as a [release](https://github.com/Lokathor/roguelike-tutorial-2018/releases).

## Story

You are KASIDIN, a TERULO. You live a quiet life of eating ROCKS and drinking
SPICY LAVA SOUP. One day, the EVIL KING ADLORI invaded the land of volcanos and
shut off all of the lava. Now there is no more spicy lava soup! You must travel
deep into the heart of the earth and defeat ADLORI to restore the soup.
